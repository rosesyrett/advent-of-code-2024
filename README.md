# Advent of Code 2024

A repository to track my progress for this years advent of code.

My approach this year has been to randomly pick a programming language for each day's challenge, as the challenges can be isolated. The languages I'm choosing between are:

- C
- C#
- C++
- Go
- Java
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- SQL
- Typescript

Yes, even SQL made the list this time. As I go through different languages, I'll leave instructions here for the code structure, or how to compile/run it if needs be.

## C++

I got this on day 1 of the advent calendar. So for this, simply navigate to any `*.cpp` files and type,

```
g++ main.cpp
```

E.g. in this instance this would produce an output called `a.out` in the directory from which this was called... This can be executed with:

```
./a.out
```

To run the compiled code.
